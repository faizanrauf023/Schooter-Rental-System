# Schooter-Rental-System

A full fledged bike rental system implemented in Python using object oriented programming.

Customers can
See available bikes on the shop
Rent bikes on hourly basis $5 per hour.
Rent bikes on daily basis $20 per day.
Rent bikes on weekly basis $60 per week.
Family Rental, a promotion that can include from 3 to 5 Rentals (of any type) with a discount of 30% of the total price
The rental shops can
issue a bill when customer decides to return the bike.
display available inventory
take requests on hourly, daily and weekly basis by cross verifying stock
Since classes are used various customers and bike rental shops can be instantiated as needed.

For simplicity we assume that any customer requests rentals of only one type i.e hourly, monthly or weekly but is free to chose the number of bikes he/she wants. However requested bikes should be less than available stock.
